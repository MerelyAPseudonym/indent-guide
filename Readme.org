** Usage

Require this script

: (require 'indent-guide)

and call command "M-x indent-guide-mode".

If you want to enable indent-guide-mode in all buffers, call function
indent-guide-global-mode.

: (indent-guide-global-mode)

** Configuration

Column lines are propertized with "indent-guide-face". So you may
configure this face to make liens more pretty in your colorscheme.

: (set-face-background 'indent-guide-face "dimgray")

If you want indent-guide to show guide lines only in idle-time, you
can set delay.

: (setq indent-guide-delay 0.1)

You may also change the character for guides.

: (setq indent-guide-char ":")

** Known Limitations

- does not work perfectly with following modes (commands) :
  + transient-mark-moe
  + auto-complete-mode (popup.el)
  + commands in pager.el
