** Usage

Require this script

: (require 'indent-guide)

then indent-guide appears automatically.

To set delay until the indent-guide appears, use function
"indent-guide-set-delay".

: (indent-guide-set-delay 1.0)

Now indent-guide appears after 1.0 sec of idle time.

Column lines have "indent-guide-face". So you may configure this face
to make liens more pretty in your colorscheme.

: (set-face-background 'indent-guide-face "dimgray")
